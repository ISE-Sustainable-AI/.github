# Sustainable AI Reserach at ISE 

Wellcome to the Sustainable AI Reserach reposetory of the [ISE chair](tu.berlin/ise) of [TU Berlin](tu.berlin). 
Climate change and the associated obligation to save resources is one of the most pressing issues of our time and must also apply to how we develop and deploy software, including deep learning models. 
Within this project we explore how to measure and address sustainability qualites in the development of deep learning models. For instance, we look into hyperparameter optimization (HPO), a necessary and very energy and resource-intensive part of the creation of these deep learning models, as it involves the search and repeated taring of deep learning models.
